* The Screenshot above is very shotty, but is not representive of the final goal. Its merely a general idea. A starting point.

YouTube Music looks boring. It's plain, it's black, and it's probably the worst example of Material Design in it's current form (or the best, depending on how you view Material Design's development these days).

I'm trying to strip whatever originality YouTube Music has, with drop shadows, light theme, rounded corners, etc.
